I've not yet been able to solve 12 summations to 42 - Perhaps I have a typo from manually entering data from the dials. I need to double check...

The highest match *so far* is 11/12 radial arrays summing to 42, which can be found with the configuration:

 1. Outer Orbital:
	 - 1,  5, 9,  7, 12, 8,  6, 8, 10,  3, 10, 12
 2. Outer Middle Orbital:
	 - 22, 26, 16, 14,  9, 13,  5,  9, 10, 19, 8, 12
 3. Inner Middle Orbital:
	 - 11,  4, 14,  7, 15, 15, 21, 14, 15,  9, 9, 12
 4. Inner Orbital:
	 - 8,  7,  3, 3,  6, 6, 10, 11, 7, 11, 15,  6
